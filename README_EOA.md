# How It Works: EOA Worker Transaction Processing

## Overview

The EOA (Externally Owned Account) Worker is a single worker per EOA:chain combination that processes all transactions for that specific EOA. It manages transaction lifecycle from queuing to confirmation, with robust error handling, nonce management, gas bumping, and webhook notifications.

## Core Architecture

### Data Structures

The worker maintains several key data structures in Redis:

- **`pending_transactions`**: ZSET of transaction IDs waiting to be sent, scored by queued timestamp
- **`submitted_transactions`**: ZSET mapping nonces to "hash:transaction_id" pairs for sent transactions  
- **`transaction_hash_to_id`**: Hash map from transaction hash to transaction ID
- **`transaction_data`**: Hash maps storing full transaction data with user requests and receipts
- **`transaction_attempts`**: Lists storing all attempts (including gas bumps) for each transaction
- **`borrowed_transactions`**: Hash map for crash recovery of prepared transactions
- **`recycled_nonces`**: ZSET of available recycled nonces from failed transactions
- **`optimistic_transaction_count`**: Counter for next nonce to use for new transactions
- **`last_transaction_count`**: Cached chain transaction count for comparison
- **`eoa_health`**: Health status including balance, thresholds, and movement tracking

### Main Worker Execution

The worker runs as a TWMQ job with three main phases executed once per job:

1. **Recovery Phase**: Recovers any borrowed transactions from crashes
2. **Confirmation Phase**: Checks for mined transactions, handles gas bumping, and manages nonce synchronization
3. **Send Phase**: Sends new transactions while managing nonce allocation and capacity

Worker execution is scheduled by the TWMQ job queue system. TWMQ acts like a "distributed async scheduler" for each `eoa:chain` "green thread". These threads suspend themselves when there is no work to do, and ask to be rescheduled when more work is available.

The above diagram illustrates the complete transaction processing flow within a single job execution. The worker operates using the TWMQ job queue system, processing available work and requeueing itself if more work remains.

## Detailed Phase Breakdown

### 1. Recovery Phase (`recover_borrowed_state`)

**Purpose**: Recover from crashes by handling any transactions that were prepared but not fully processed.

**Process**:

- Retrieves all transactions from `borrowed_transactions` hashmap
- Sorts by nonce to ensure proper ordering during rebroadcast
- Rebroadcasts each signed transaction in parallel to the RPC
- Classifies results using the sophisticated error classification system
- Uses batch processing to atomically move transactions to final states
- Queues webhook notifications for state changes

**Key Insight**: Provides crash resilience while maintaining transaction ordering and proper state transitions. "Borrowed transactions" are funcationally a write-ahead-log for the worker.

### 2. Confirmation Phase (`confirm_flow`) 

**Purpose**: Identify completed transactions, handle gas bumping for stalled nonces, and maintain nonce synchronization.

**Process**:

- Fetches current chain transaction count and compares with cached value
- **No Progress Path**: If no nonce advancement, checks for stalled transactions
  - If a nonce is stalled for >5 minutes with pending transactions, attempts gas bumping
  - Finds the newest transaction for the stalled nonce and rebuilds with 20% gas increase
  - If no transactions exist for the nonce, sends a noop transaction
- **Progress Path**: If nonces advanced, processes confirmations
  - Fetches receipts for all submitted transactions below current transaction count
  - Categorizes as confirmed (has receipt) or replaced (no receipt)
  - Atomically cleans confirmed transactions and updates mappings
  - Updates cached transaction count and health timestamps
- Queues webhook notifications for all state changes

**Key Insight**: Combines confirmation checking with proactive gas bumping to prevent transaction stalls.

### 3. Send Phase (`send_flow`)

**Purpose**: Send new transactions while managing nonce allocation, capacity limits, and EOA health.

**Components**:

#### A. Health Check and Balance Management

- Retrieves or initializes EOA health data with balance, thresholds, and timestamps
- Updates balance if stale (>5 minutes since last check)
- Compares balance against dynamic threshold (updated based on transaction failures)
- Skips sending if balance is insufficient

#### B. Recycled Nonce Processing

- **Overflow Protection**: Cleans recycled nonces if count exceeds `MAX_RECYCLED_THRESHOLD` (50)
- **Batch Processing**: Matches recycled nonces with pending transactions
- **Parallel Preparation**: Builds and signs multiple transactions concurrently
- **Error Handling**: Filters preparation failures and handles balance threshold updates
- **Atomic State Transitions**: Uses WATCH/MULTI/EXEC for race-free state changes
- **Noop Handling**: Sends empty transactions for unused recycled nonces

#### C. New Transaction Processing

- **Budget Calculation**: Determines available capacity using `MAX_INFLIGHT_PER_EOA` (100)
- **Sequential Nonce Assignment**: Assigns consecutive nonces starting from optimistic counter
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple transactions up to available budget
- **Atomic Nonce Management**: Atomically increments optimistic counter during state transitions
- **Retry Logic**: Fixed iteration limit prevents infinite loops during high failure rates

## Advanced Features

### Gas Bumping System

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Nonce hasn't moved for >5 minutes (`NONCE_STALL_TIMEOUT`)
- Submitted transactions exist for the stalled nonce

**Process**:
1. Identifies newest transaction for the stalled nonce
2. Rebuilds transaction with 20% gas price increase
3. Signs and records as new attempt in transaction history
4. Broadcasts bumped transaction
5. Falls back to noop transaction if no transactions exist

### Atomic State Management

**Lock Acquisition**:
- Aggressive lock takeover for stalled workers
- Redis-based distributed locking per EOA:chain combination

**Transaction Safety**:
- All state changes use Redis WATCH/MULTI/EXEC for atomicity
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for contention
- Lock ownership validation before every operation

### Webhook Integration

**Event Types**:
- Transaction submitted
- Transaction confirmed  
- Transaction failed
- Transaction replaced

**Delivery**:
- Queued via TWMQ for reliable delivery
- Supports multiple webhook endpoints per transaction
- Includes full transaction data and receipts

## Error Classification System

### Deterministic Failures
- Invalid transaction parameters
- Insufficient balance (below threshold)
- Transaction simulation failures
- **Action**: Immediate failure + webhook notification

### Success Cases  
- Explicit RPC success
- "already known" (duplicate submission)
- "nonce too low" (already mined)
- **Action**: Move to submitted state

### Indeterminate Cases
- Network timeouts
- Temporary RPC failures  
- Unknown RPC errors
- **Action**: Assume sent (optimistic approach)

### Balance Threshold Management
- Dynamically updated based on transaction failures
- Prevents wasteful RPC calls when EOA lacks funds
- Automatically refreshed when transactions fail due to balance

## Nonce Management Strategy

### Optimistic Transaction Count
- Tracks next available nonce independent of chain state
- Atomically incremented when moving transactions to borrowed state
- Enables parallel transaction preparation

### Cached Transaction Count
- Periodically synced with actual chain state during confirmation
- Used for inflight budget calculations and confirmation checks
- Updated atomically with health timestamps

### Recycled Nonce Pool
- Reuses nonces from definitively failed transactions
- Bounded size with automatic cleanup at `MAX_RECYCLED_THRESHOLD`
- Priority processing before new nonces

### Nonce Reset Protection
- Automatic reset when sync issues detected
- Tracks reset history in health data for monitoring
- Prevents state corruption during chain reorganizations

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Job-Based Execution
- **Benefit**: Natural backpressure and resource management via TWMQ
- **Trade-off**: Latency depends on queue processing speed

### 2. Aggressive Lock Acquisition  
- **Benefit**: Handles worker crashes and stalls gracefully
- **Trade-off**: Potential work duplication during handoffs

### 3. Atomic State Transitions
- **Benefit**: Strong consistency guarantees even during failures
- **Trade-off**: Increased complexity and potential retry overhead

### 4. Batch Processing
- **Benefit**: High throughput via parallel RPC calls and atomic state updates
- **Trade-off**: More complex error handling and state management

### 5. Gas Bumping Integration
- **Benefit**: Proactive handling of network congestion
- **Trade-off**: Additional RPC overhead and complexity

### 6. Dynamic Balance Thresholds
- **Benefit**: Adapts to changing gas prices and network conditions
- **Trade-off**: Potential for false positives during price volatility

## Configuration Parameters

- **`MAX_INFLIGHT_PER_EOA`**: 100 - Maximum concurrent unconfirmed transactions
- **`MAX_RECYCLED_THRESHOLD`**: 50 - Maximum recycled nonces before cleanup  
- **`TARGET_TRANSACTIONS_PER_EOA`**: 10 - Fleet management target
- **`MIN_TRANSACTIONS_PER_EOA`**: 1 - Fleet management minimum
- **`NONCE_STALL_TIMEOUT`**: 300,000ms (5 minutes) - Gas bump trigger
- **`HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL`**: 300s (5 minutes) - Balance refresh interval

## Monitoring and Observability

The worker exposes several metrics through the job result:

- **Queue Metrics**: Pending, borrowed, and submitted transaction counts
- **Nonce Metrics**: Recycled nonce count and optimistic nonce position
- **Processing Metrics**: Transactions recovered, confirmed, failed, and sent per job
- **Health Metrics**: Balance status, last check timestamp, nonce reset history

## Failure Modes and Recovery

### Common Failure Scenarios

1. **EOA Runs Out of Funds**
   - **Detection**: Balance check against dynamic threshold
   - **Recovery**: Automatic retry when balance threshold is met

2. **Network Partitions**
   - **Detection**: RPC call failures during any phase
   - **Recovery**: Job requeue with exponential backoff

3. **Worker Crashes**
   - **Detection**: Lock timeout and aggressive takeover
   - **Recovery**: Borrowed transaction rebroadcast ensures no loss

4. **Nonce Stalls**
   - **Detection**: Time-based stall detection (5-minute timeout)
   - **Recovery**: Automatic gas bumping or noop transactions

5. **Chain Reorganizations**
   - **Detection**: Chain transaction count inconsistencies
   - **Recovery**: Confirmation phase handles dropped transactions

6. **State Corruption**
   - **Detection**: Optimistic nonce validation failures
   - **Recovery**: Automatic nonce reset to chain state

This architecture provides a robust, scalable solution for managing EOA transactions with strong consistency guarantees, proactive congestion handling, and comprehensive failure recovery mechanisms.
